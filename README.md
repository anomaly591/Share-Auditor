# Share-Auditor
Share Auditor audits local and network folder permissions and then exports the results to CSV. With Share Auditor, you can configure how many inner folders you can include in the scan. 

Share Auditor is a portable Windows application and will run the audit scan under the privileges of the user account who launched the scan. 


**Recommended Minimum Requirements**

Operating System: Windows 7 or higher, Windows 2008 R2 or higher

.NET Framework: 4.5 or higher

**Recommended Usage**

Launch the application under an account which has access to the share being audited to have the most success auditing.

Please remember that if the account that launches the application cannot access a folder, it will be unable to audit any further into that folder, and will simply skip the folder and move on.
